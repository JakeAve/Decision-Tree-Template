# Decision-Tree-Template
Javascript-based decision tree display and editor. Does not require a server.
Use the Edit_Tree.html to access an interface that compiles a JSON-like string, which you can save in /data/dataForTree.js
Use the Decision_Tree.html to run a decision tree based on the information in /data/dataForTree.js
This was designed to work locally for my needs, but you should compile and save a JSON file using a database.
